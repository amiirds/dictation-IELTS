## Description

Dictation IELTS is a Python-based project designed to help users improve their dictation skills for the IELTS exam. The project includes functionalities to practice dictation by using word lists and audio files, track mistakes, and review correct spellings. It aims to provide an effective tool for language learners to enhance their listening and writing abilities.

2. **Using Word Lists:**
